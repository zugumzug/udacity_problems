This is a repository of small practice programs executed for Udacity.com classes. I think they are good examples of my programming growth over time. As a document of my ongoing learning I have not gone back to "optimize" many of the more elementary programs even though it would make sense to do so if they were really in use.  But somtimes I can't help but just improve them a little bit now that I know a little more.
